                <p class="text-paragraph">So... Right now it's my day-off today. Together with my girlfriend Malwina I'm working at Odda Camping as  receptionists. It's located in south-western Norway and there are many people going to a popular mountain hike called Trolltunga. In my free time I hard code PSD Templates, mainly from webcamp, in which I took part this winter. Soon we're going on a bicycle trip to Portugal. We want to go to Bordeaux, but it's a but complicated as we have to be back till the beginning of October because she's going to study Graphic Design.</p>
                <p class="text-paragraph">I guess it's enough for now, I'll probably rewrite it all anyway.</p>
                <p class="text-paragraph">Cheers!</p>
